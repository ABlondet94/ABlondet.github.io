4. #About me#
5. ##MY Interest and Hobbies##
6. Some interest of mine include **working out**, **family time**, going to the **range**, learning new **factual information** and **riding my motorcycle**. Recently since getting out of the military and have graduated with my accounting degree in Spring 2025, I've really been getting involved with reading as well, especialy in areas involving **psychology** and **reverse psychology**. Currently I'm reading two books, _Don't give the enemy a seat at your table_ by Louie Giglio, and _Dark Psychology and Manipulation_ by Mario Scott.

7. ##Websites I Recommend##
8. Some Website areas I would recommend for bike riders in general who're learning to ride would definitely be any videos involving guys starting off on 300's. Many people go crazy but for informational purpose on [How to start off riding](https://youtu.be/jP9z9Ig0JPA?si=Anr1krxt3YBGG8D1) so you can get the basics, or take a [Motorcycle MSF Course](https://youtu.be/TUsjp8TsYcA?si=ZCZepZi-YSpk54bn) which could help you on what to expect.
